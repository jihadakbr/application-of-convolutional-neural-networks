## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a mood classifier using the TF Keras Sequential API. The aim is to construct a ConvNet (Convolutional Neural Network) that can accurately identify sign language digits. Through the TF Keras Functional API, we will build the model and train it on a dataset of sign language images, effectively enabling it to classify different sign language digits. By the end of this endeavor, we will have achieved a comprehensive understanding of both the Sequential and Functional APIs of TensorFlow Keras and applied them to create two distinct yet powerful models for mood classification and sign language digit identification.
